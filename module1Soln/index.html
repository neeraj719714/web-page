                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parma is the most gullible guy i have ever met in my life. One best thing about him is his honesty. Truely he is best
                    for anyone. Never asks for anything.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pari is the fat guy of our group. the most funny but probably most handy in times of need. Although this lockdown corona era fucked 
                    our college life we still do video chats sometime.
